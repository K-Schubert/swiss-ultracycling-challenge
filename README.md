# swiss-ultracycling-challenge
This project aims to solve the problem of optimal route creation for the Swiss Ultracycling Challenge (SUCH). Given a set of mandatory checkpoints, the algorithm will find the shortest path to visit all Swiss cantons and checkpoints using Google Maps data, minimizing elevation and distance. This problem is an instance of the AGTSP (Asymmetric Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem) where a set of points are partitioned into clusters (cantons), and the cyclist has to visit every cluster exactly once.

Solve the 2021 and 2022 editions.

Characteristics of the 2021 edition.

Characteristics of the 2022 edition.

Google maps data.

Problem definition.

Proposed approach: Use intersection of cantonal borders and road network.
